====== ADFS Configuration Helper ======

This tool helps you to find the right configuration paramters for the ADSF plugin by parsing the Federation metadata provided by your Identity Provider.

For Active Directory Federation Services the metadata can be found at ''%%https://<your-adfs-server>/FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml%%''. Simply paste this URL (with the correct server name) below.

Please note that PHP will check the certificate validity, so if you use a self signed or corporate internal certificate you need to download the file yourself and paste it into the XML field below.
